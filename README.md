Russian Roulette is a bear market 'community hedge concept', a hardcore ponzi, that also thrives during the bull season. 
In this experiment we want to explore the effects of extreme taxes and buybacks, coupled with limited batched sells, on sustainability. 
In order to create a community bear market hedge that also thrives during the bull season. 
The goal is to contain value within the project, so that we can guarantee token value to investors in return. 
In other projects which guarantee value using staking alongside rebasing, you tie your investment to the project manually, here you just need to buy and then try schedule a low tax sell. Thats all. 
We then use taxes, collected as tokens and liquidated to eth through buys via our contract, to issue rewards and guarantee token value; by buying up any sells into the LP. 
This means no unplanned outflows from the LP, each outflow has to be accounted for and replaced. 
This happens in controlled batches every Saturday (Russian Roulette Day) Again, taxes revenue is used to fund the project operations: buybacks (bornfire events) and treasury to invest for profit ouside the dao. 
We bypass Uniswaps tax limitations by using our contract as proxy to allow 90% sell tax. Try it! 
To get a 10% sell tax, you schedule your sell through: russian roulette or staking 6 months. 
The whole project depends on 3 contracts: main, rebalancing wallet and treasury wallet. 
All contracts written in Solidity 0.84
