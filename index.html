                        <span class="carousel_info">Russian Roulette is a community hedge concept, a ponzi, that also thrives during the bull season. Here nothing is static ~ everything is responsive to market cycles and the subsequent buy or sell pressures. Its comprised of 3 contracts: Main, Rebalancing Wallet, and Treasury. The rebalancing wallet is a community controlled contract responsible to for responsively allocating fees where needed. To maximise on value containment, the primary goal of the RBW contract is to attempt to use buybacks to replace all eth lost from the liquidity pool. It automatically tracks the value of tokens scheduled for a sell and keeps a reserve for buybacks, sending only the excess to treasury. During the bear season our sell taxes are a radical 90% to discourage selling. Unless you schedule a sell then its 10% sell tax. But during the bull season we lower taxes based on fees collected to RBW. Taxes are not lowered blindly because the Rebalancing Bias will be blown out of range as holders take profit during the bull season, pushing the NVL higher. Bringing it down after so the RBW can function normally within ranges during the bear season would be hard since fees accured at this time will be insignificant compared to the unchecked NVL. So we remain responsive to the trading volume and lower to what we can cover, such that the rbb is always within a healthy and functional range. The scheduling of sells is left to chance through Russian Roulette. The value containment responsive nature of this project is what makes it a hedge, and its designed to be undumpable, and present the real first Up Only scenario.</span>

                        <span class="carousel_info">This is a ponzi. We exist to explore sustainability in the crypto space, specifically for no-use-case projects. With the hope to see similar mechanisms developed or adopted across the industry to create a safe sustainable enviroment for investors. In this experiment we want to explore the effects of extreme taxing and buybacks, coupled with limited batched sells, on economic sustainability. In taxed txs projects, the trading volume and inherently taxes collected are the only income stream, and its worth preserving that life line. No project can simultaneously withstand unlimited value drain via unchecked sells whilst guaranteeing profit for all investors regardless of entry price, except possibly during the bull season when theres little to no damage to the project. Rebasing tokens tried guaranteeing value with an inflationary approach and failed. Staking mechanisms which were once viewed as the holy grail of managing sell pressure came and failed to do so. Now we have taxes. The goal is to contain value within the project, long enough for the project to achieve its goals or become TBTF. The goal is not just passive income but to also guarantee token value retention for all holders.</br></br></br></br></br></span>

                    <article id="carousel_3">
                        <span class="carousel_info">All taxes are collected in tokens on the contract. They are not liquidated through the liquidity pool as this defeats the whole point, they are liquidated through proxy-buys using our contract. We offer a 5-10% discount on tokens bought through the proxy dex as you will be helping liquidate fee tokens. The buy tax is a constant 15% but can be lower if the fee liquidation discount is factored in, thats if there are fee tokens available to meet your buy request. Once converted to ETH, all the income is automatically send to the Rebalancing Wallet, which is a community controlled contract, resposible for making buybacks or treasury allocations(another wallet), responsively to the buy and sell pressures. There are no blind allocations, the health of the project is guaged on Net Value Lost from the Liquidity pool, compared to buybacks, to give a RBB (rebelancing bias). The rebalancing bias is used by the contract to automatically trigger a buyback if the RBB is out of the healthy range, below 1 or above 1.5. Any community member can trigger this, when in a healthy range the contract then switches to allocations based on poll outcome. Each poll is time limited, and minimum voter checked, and on conclusion automatically allocates funds to where the community voted for, an automatic buy back or sending to treasury contract. There is no owner intervention whatsover on the Rebalancing Wallet.</br></br></br></span>

                    <article id="carousel_4">
                        <span class="carousel_info">Though theres a 90% tax in place (variable remember) its not a honeypot, holders can <b>actually sell</b> whenever they want into our Uniswap Liquidity Pool, just through our contract as a proxy. Most people are used to losing 90% or more of their holdings anyway in shit projects, so if investors want a quick way out at the expense of long term holders, we expect them to take the 90% loss. Instead of selling out of schedule we encourage the use of Share Leasing where you can rent out your tokens to another party and get a net equivalent or estimate today of all rewards expected during the lease period. In addition, Share bidding will be introduced which facilitates transfer of ownership outside of the LP using a bid and offer approach in fixed lots. The proxy dex will compete by offering discounts on fee tokens to lure buyers back to the Uniswap liquidity pool. Normally when people sell frantically it harms the holders, here it harms only the sellers, and leave the holders in a better place. In summary, with these new tokenomics, we are aiming to: guarantee value where Rebasing mechanisms failed to, and effectively manage sell pressure where Staking mechanisms failed to.</br></br></br></br></br></span>

            <h4>Quick round up</h4>
            <span>
                Buy Backs and Burns (Bonfires) are not up to the admin, they are fully under the control of the community and its automated to settle once a poll ends. All fess collected
                end up in the decision making vote of the investor. The goal set for the community is to simply buy back all the ETH lost from the LP that month. If there is excess cash then
                it the community can vote to send it to the Treasury for passive income investing.
                </br></br>
                We also dont liquidate fee tokens in the LP like most projects do. We liquidate them through Discounted Proxy Buys, on our Dex, you cant get these discounts on Uniswap.
                Other supporting mechanisms to protect the LP are Share Leasing and Share Bidding (Discounted Cash Flows). These divert selling pressure from the LP. We understand the need to become liquid
                but we want it at the expense of the LP. You can get liquidity from your tokens through leasing them out or transferring "your holdings enterprise" to a new owner at a discount.
                </br></br>
                Our aim is not just to give reflections, but to also give holders a fair opportunity to offload tokens at high ROI. In predictable and controlled batches.
                </br></br>
                The main goal of this project is to protect and retain value: both token price and treasury capital. Using high taxes to funnel sell pressure and introduce a 
                factor of predictability, using share bidding to avoid value drain from the liquidity pool, using Russian Roulette to distribute opportunity equally, a 
                rebalancing wallet to channel funds where they are needed the most instead of blind allocations, and saloon contracts to boost token utility.
            </span>
            <h4>Tax quitters, reward holders</h4>
            <span>
                Normally when people sell frantically it harms those who hold on as they drain all the ETH, in this case holders are unscathed. Even if 10 people stay behind, they will profit 
                from all the LP ETH and Rewards left by quiters. You hold - you win, they sell- you win, the only way to lose is to sell outside your turn. This should give investors sleep at night.

            <ol class="ol_issues">
                <li>Unsustainable value leaking tokenomics models. Most projects pump and fizzle out no matter how good the narrative is. The goal is to sleep at night if you're in a solid project. </li>
                <li>Channelling of project funds or fees collected is not thoughtful or responsive in almost all taxing projects.</li>
                <li>Buy and sell pressures are unregulated, especially the later, leading to incidents where panic selling kills the project without cause.</li>
                <li>Inability to predict future market forces, in turn harming financial planning and decision making today.</li>
                <li>Quick flippers tolerated at the expense of long term holders.</li>
                <li>Late comers are not accomodated and face negligible rewards.</li>
                <li>Lack of token utility, our project is weaved from the base up to make the token valuable.</li>
                <li>GameFi shouldnt be the main product, but a utility tool to facilitate a core fundamental function.</li>
                <li>DAOs have limited powers in managing the health of the project. Relying solely on the owner, it can be disastrous: citing incidents where rebasing projects failed to buy back with their treasury as intended.</li>
                <li>Purposeless crypto. Crypto is establishing roots in every corner of society to be the change enabler, lets push it.</li>
                <li>Limited financial mechanisms are currently adopted across the industry.</li>

                        <li>15% buy Tax (5% reflections in ETH, 10% goes to Rebalancing wallet).</li>
                        <li>Sell tax is variable, 90% during bear season, and during the bull season its determined by fees collected.</li>
                        <li>90% of the total supply is deployed in the liquidity pool on a fair launch, with 10% going to the team in the owner wallet.</li>
                        <li>Trading starts automatically at a certain block number and cannot be stopped.</li>
                        <li>Wallet to wallet transfer are disabled to avoid cheating in scheduling a sell through Russian Roulette.</li>
                        <li>Aim is to keep Net Value Lost (NVL) in the project as close to zero as possible.</li>
                        <li>All tokens bought back are burnt thought the bonfire function. Anyone can burn directly if they are feeling generous.</li>

                        <li>Investors can buy and stake tokens directly on the contract. Staking six months qualifies the wallet to schedule a 10% sell automatically upon maturity, at least 50% of your wallet tokens need to be staked to qualify.</li>

                        <li>If you win, you can go on to sell your GUN tokens at 10% sell tax any coming Saturday.</li>
                        <li>If you lose, the 90% sell tax still applies for the month.</li>

                    <p>This is a true decentralised autonomous ponzi, a community hedge concept, a zero loss ecosystem - piggy bank, meant to challenge existing limitations and evolve the space towards stability & sustainability. After all the defi drama this cycle, the only thing that can protect investors from dumps is ultimately tokenomics and carefully structured taxes.With our model, an attempt to dump the price benefits the holders directly, whilst holding also benefits the holders.</p>

                    <p>"However, one thing to note nevertheless: everyone wanted high returns at a shorter time frame. So kind of treating the space like a golden goose that lays golden eggs. In case, the goose fails to lay the golden, let’s cut that goose and search for another one that lays golden eggs. Thus summing up the reason why terms like vampire attack, rug-pulls, and getting Rekt overnight floated thick and fast within the DeFi 1.0 ecosystem. As a result, the ecosystem wanted more control over the liquidity to make their protocols sustain for long. It was at that point in time when innovations like Olympus DAO swiftly made inroads seeing the success of MakerDAO protocols. However, the protocol did enter the DeFi space with an upside by working on all odds left by the erstwhile algorithmic stablecoin protocols." ~ cryptoticker.io Jan 2022</br></br>But rebase tokens recorded significant failures despite their novelty, maybe its time to go back to basics, and try find simple alternatives for stability. The taxing approach.</p>

                <summary>Why?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>What if we try guarantee token value using just taxes? and throw away all the complexities, then structure a strong framework just centered around taxes. High taxes are deemed bad but they can actually be beneficial, nobody has just tried it. Whilst scammers used them as honeypots, Safemoon proved taxes can instead be useful to effect & guarantee a desired economic outcome than benefits investors not harm them. When this idea was concieved the struggle was to find a balance between making high taxes useful but whilst also abiding to Uniswap's tax constrictions, in order to remain functional bespite breaching tax limits. Rules are meant to be bent, especially if theres a common good coming out of it and possibly force a re-think of current industry limitations/standards. The end goal is the same; a safe, stable, sustainable ecosystem to invest in long term. No project has achieved that so far, so why not explore all avenues?</p>

                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>90% sell tax which changes to 10% under strict conditions. 90% tax is obviously meant to discourage any selling, except if a sell is scheduled then its 10%. The scheduling is left to chance and in limited batches.</br>OHM forks were the closest thing to a tokenomics model that would let you sleep at night, your initial investment had a great degree of guarantee it wouldnt fall below the backed price. With Russian Roulette, inspired by Safemoon's 100% tax to force people to move to V3, we are using taxes to manipulate the token price.</p>

                    <p>To be honest, why should we confine to the rules set by one Dex that transactions with taxes above 50% shouldnt go through? Shouldnt everything be possible in this space as long as there are benefits to it? We should break the stigma, keep evolving past these tax limitations set by other projects!

                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>You can sell anytime you want, despite the 90% tax. Just not on Uniswaps front end, but using our contract as a proxy that points to Uniswap on your behalf. Heres how to test it, with even $1: buy tokens from Uniswap or our ProxyDex, delegate them for sell, and swap back eth, and see that is works. You sell into the same Uniswap liquidity pool as you would using uniswap's front end if it allowed taxes higher than 49%. Our contract as proxy accepts your tokens and perfoms the sell transaction on your behalf, sending eth direct to your wallet. You can cancel at any stage after delegating tokens to our contract and withdraw them back to your wallet. </p>

                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>Token locks only work when everyone commits. {3,3} Has been porpular for a reason, based on the faith that everyone will hold, but if anything the market never thinks in unison. Staking imposed 2 problems: <b>one</b>, the need to offer rewards in return, rewards which were unsustainable as a desperate appeal. <b>Two</b>, there is no way of accurately predicting the sell pressure when the tokens are unlocked, how many investors want to sell and how many want to rollover locks. Imposing sell taxes on the other hand allows us to predict and plan accordingly. We know how many people will sell on R.R Day with low taxes, we know the size of their wallets, and we have a month to prepare for the buy backs and burns. </p>

                <summary>What's a Rebalancing wallet?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>Its a community controlled wallet (smart contract), that acts as the intermediary to receive eth obtained from fees, then determine the beneficial way to allocate them based on sell and buy pressures. Other projects normally have a fixed amount that just goes to the treasury wallet, and to buy backs, with no actual justification for allocating the amounts. Based on trading volume it may be too little, it may be too much deployed to the treasury/buy backs. </p>

                <summary>How does a Rebalancing wallet work?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>Since there is a trade off between keeping a healthy token price and growing the treasury wallet, we measure buy pressure and sell pressure to determine what to prioritize between buybacks and growing our treasury. </br>If the buy pressure is high all excess after "sufficient buybacks" is send to the treasury wallet (contract). If the sell pressure is high, net eth lost is high and we step up allocations towards buybacks.</br>How is this done?</br>The Rebalancing wallet uses net eth outflows from the LP, versus the net buybacks in eth ever. NVL/buybacks = Rebalancing bias (RBB level). Ideally an RBB of 1 is perfect, but not realistic all the time. So the wallet is programmed to keep an eye on the minimum RBB 1, Median RBB 1.25, and max RBB 1.5 to determine how much to allocate towards buybacks and afterwards, how much to send to the treasury wallet. This is done automatically. This is a true self governance project, the community controls the RB wallet, the owner has no control over theses funds whatsoever, the automated checks in place are enough. So there is a polling range (between 1 & 1.5) and an auto-rebalancing range (below 1 or above 1.5). Whilst in the former, any community member can automatically trigger a rebalance. When in the latter range, any community member can trigger a poll for the community to vote on where to send funds. On poll conclusion it allocates funds automatically based on the poll results.</p>

                <summary>How to reduce taxes to 10%?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>2 ways: Play Russian Roulette with the tax man, or Stake for 6 months. To make scheduling fair we leave it to chance. Each wallet can only play once each month, if you win you can sell any Saturday. You pick a cylinder. The goal is to kill the tax man, if you spin and the taxman pulls the trigger from the same cylinder you loaded, he dies and you are automatically on the tax free list for the month. Each wallet has a 1 in 6 chance of success. This effectively leaves the scheduling of a sell to chance. The alternative approach is to buy and stake on the main contract for 6 months. Allocations for these slots is on a first come first serve basis, slots are limited based on excess collected by the RBW and send to Treasury, or what the team thinks we can afford to cover in future based on current income.</p>

                <summary>Why arent 10% tax Sells based the RBW purse eth size?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>Selling into the RBW eth balance would lead to scenarios where the reserved Eth on RBW can be depleted before all shceduled wallets sell. Which then defeats the point of scheduling.</p>

                    <p>We cant renounce. We need to have the ability to lower or increase taxes as the DAO deems fit. In addition to: setting discount on fee tokens bought via our proxy dex, setting limit on number of wallets who can stake for 6months this month (Sixers), registering third party contracts built on top of our main contract as fee collectors, Owner wallet does not control RBW or fees collected in any way, its merely a by stander. Owner cannot stop trading, RBW, or Treasury wallet in any way. Owner cannot withdraw any Eth funds from any of the contracts. Owner is tax excluded but cannot sell, can only send tokens tax free to other wallets meant for team members or incentive programs.</p>
